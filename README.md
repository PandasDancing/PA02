# PA02

## Add key controls Q and E to rotate the avatar camera view to the left and right, respectively

### Look at how we move the avatar camera forward and backward and up and down with arrow keys

## Replace the box avatar with a Monkey avatar (but still use the Physijs.BoxMesh container for the Physics)

### See L11 about Loading objects

## Create a NonPlayableCharacter which moves toward the avatar if the avatar gets too close (e.g. 20 meters away)

### You can use the lookAt method to have the NPC face the avatar,

## When the NPC hits the Avatar, the avatar should lose a point of health and the NPC should be teleported to a random position on the board

### see how we teleported the avatar with the "h" key

## When the Avatar reaches zero health, the game should go to a You Lose scene, which the player can restart with the "r" key

### look at how we handle the "win" situation

## Add a start screen, where the user can initiate play by hitting the P key

### Each member of the team should also add at least one additional feature to the game
